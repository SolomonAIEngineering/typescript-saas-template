/**
 * Represents the team_members table in the database.
 * This table manages the many-to-many relationship between teams, user accounts, and business accounts.
 *
 * @property {number} teamId - Foreign key referencing the associated team in the teams table.
 * @property {number} userAccountId - Foreign key referencing the associated user account in the userAccounts table.
 * @property {number} businessAccountId - Foreign key referencing the associated business account in the businessAccounts table.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - The combination of teamId, userAccountId, and businessAccountId forms a composite primary key.
 * - This structure allows for flexible team membership, where a user or business can be part of multiple teams,
 *   and a team can have multiple users and businesses as members.
 * - Consider adding additional fields like 'joinedAt' or 'role' to capture more information about team membership.
